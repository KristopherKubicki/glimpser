            <h3>Adding a Template: Example with time.gov</h3>
            <p>Let's walk through the process of adding a template for time.gov:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on "Add Template" on the home page to open the template form.</li>
                <li>Fill in the following details:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Template Name:</strong> Enter "US Official Time"</li>
                        <li><strong>URL:</strong> Enter "https://time.gov"</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequency (minutes):</strong> Enter "60" to capture once per hour</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeout (seconds):</strong> Enter "10" for a reasonable load time</li>
                        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> You can enter "Official US time website" or leave it blank</li>
                        <li><strong>Object Filter:</strong> Leave blank as we don't need to filter specific objects</li>
                        <li><strong>Object Confidence:</strong> Leave blank as we're not using object detection</li>
                        <li><strong>Popup XPath:</strong> Leave blank as time.gov doesn't have popups we need to handle</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated XPath:</strong> Enter "//div[@id='time-display']" to focus on the time display</li>
                        <li><strong>Callback URL:</strong> Leave blank unless you have a specific callback service</li>
                        <li><strong>Proxy:</strong> Leave blank unless you need to use a proxy</li>
                        <li><strong>Groups:</strong> You can enter "Time" or leave it blank</li>
                        <li><strong>Rollback Frames:</strong> Enter "0" as we don't need to rollback for this static display</li>
                        <li><strong>Invert:</strong> Leave unchecked</li>
                        <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> You can check this if you prefer a dark background</li>
                        <li><strong>Headless:</strong> Leave checked for background processing</li>
                        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Leave unchecked as time.gov doesn't require stealth mode</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Click "Submit" to create your new template.</li>
